# Jifwa 🧠📄  
**AI-Native Contract Execution Platform**

Jifwa turns signed contracts into clear, trackable execution workflows — so what’s agreed actually gets delivered.

> Contracts don’t fail. Execution does.

---

## 🚨 The Problem
After a contract is signed:
- Deliverables get interpreted differently  
- Acceptance criteria stay vague  
- Proof lives in emails, WhatsApp, Drive  
- Feedback becomes emotional  
- Disputes lack structured evidence  

Execution breaks. Accountability disappears.

---

## ✅ The Solution
Jifwa adds an **execution clarity layer** on top of contracts.

**What Jifwa is:**
- Execution alignment platform
- AI-guided delivery workflow
- Privacy-first by design

**What Jifwa is NOT:**
- ❌ Contract drafting tool  
- ❌ Project management tool  
- ❌ Legal advice platform

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Upload Contract (PDF)**  
   AI extracts deliverables, dates, and key terms  
2. **AI Milestones**  
   Suggested milestones + acceptance criteria  
3. **Vendor Submissions**  
   Proof, files, and notes — in one place  
4. **Client Review**  
   Approve, request changes, or raise disputes  
5. **AI Dispute Summary**  
   Timeline + evidence + issue summary  

Everything is tracked. Nothing is lost.
